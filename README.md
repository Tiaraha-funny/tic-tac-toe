# Tic Tac Toe

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Description

Tic tac toe is a game that allows users to fill squares and align thier pieces diagonally, vertically or horizontally.

They can win by timeout and get the ligned pieces.

The game is considered to be draw when there is no ligned peices and the time is not out.

## Things I learned

By building this project, I learned how to use redux toolkit on my own.
I learned how to count down by using setInterval and clearInterval with useEffect.
I learned how to store states and get them from selector in reducer.
